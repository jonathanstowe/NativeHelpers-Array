# NativeHelpers::Array

Helper subroutines for working with Perl6 Native Arrays (CArray)

## Description

This provides a number of exported subroutines that may prove
useful when dealing with array data in a native binding.

The subroutines themselves are not particularly sophisticated
but having them in a separate module saves copying the code
into modules where they may be useful.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working perl6 installation you should be able to
install this with *zef* :

    zef install .

Remote installation

    zef install NativeHelpers::Array

Other install mechanisms may be become available in the future.

## Support

This should be considered experimental software until such time that
Perl 6 reaches an official release.  However suggestions/patches are
welcomed via github at

https://github.com/jonathanstowe/NativeHelpers-Array/issues

## Licence
