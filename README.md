# NativeHelpers::Array

Helper subroutines for working with Raku Native Arrays (CArray)

![Build Status](https://github.com/jonathanstowe/NativeHelpers-Array/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Description

This provides a number of exported subroutines that may prove
useful when dealing with array data in a native binding.

The subroutines themselves are not particularly sophisticated
but having them in a separate module saves copying the code
into modules where they may be useful.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working raku installation you should be able to install this with *zef* :

    zef install .

Remote installation

    zef install NativeHelpers::Array

Other install mechanisms may be become available in the future.

## Support

Suggestions/patches are welcomed via github at https://github.com/jonathanstowe/NativeHelpers-Array/issues

## Licence

This is free software.
